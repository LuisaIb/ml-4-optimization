Algorithms and models for AI-driven test function generation and optimization, using BBOB synthetic benchmarks (f1, f24) for empirical evaluation.

---
**Task Description:**<br>
The task entails the generation of test functions for optimization algorithms using artificial intelligence or machine learning models. Emphasis is placed on the informed selection of an appropriate approach or model, followed by practical implementation and investigation.<br>
In an empirical experiment, an assessment should be made of how effectively the chosen models solve the problem. Synthetic ground-truth functions from the BBOB function suite should be utilized for this purpose.<br>
Various resources are available for implementation:
- COCO: http://numbbo.github.io/coco/shortintro
- R Code: https://cran.r-project.org/package=smoof
- Python Code: https://pypi.org/project/BBOBtorch/ (or https://github.com/numbbo/coco)
  
It is not necessary to utilize all BBOB functions; instead, a focus on functions such as f1, f2, and f4 (BBOB-instances 1, 3, and 24) will suffice.
